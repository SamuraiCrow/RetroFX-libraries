# RetroFX

---

A shared library collection for implementing tilemaps and sprites for gaming on Commodore Amiga computers with OpenGL support to follow thereafter.  For documentation, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/SamuraiCrow/RetroFX-libraries/wiki).

For NextGen support see [RetroMode](https://github.com/khval/RetroMode-AmigaOS-GFXLIB).  Future versions of this library will be compatible with it.
